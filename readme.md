# IPPT Tracker
This is my first application. It was created using JavaFX. I created it with the help of an online tutorial: http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/. The DarkThemes.css was taken from the tutorial and edited lightly.

## BUGS...
I just realised that the application became super buggy after I tried adding more warning dialog boxes and the splash screen so I am rolling back as far back as I can so I can save some of the basic functionality and my sanity :(. Looks like I will need to go slower and test everything thoroughly.

## How to Run
Download/Clone the repo. Then go into the dist folder and run the IPPTTracker.jar. It works by making you save an xml file with your result details. You can open a different xml file as well, as long as the format is the same. I have also provided a sample xml file in the resources/sample/ folder.

## Possible Features to Add
These are some of the following things that I may or may not work on in the near future, depending on how much time I have on my hands :P
- Splash Screen: I still need to figure out how to add the Splash Screen when my code format follows the tutorial so closely. I was trying to implement the one demonstrated in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f06uUtkmtDE&t=374s but there must have been some bugs. Can anyone help the newbie? XD

- IPPT Score Calculator: Currently when you add a result instance it only allows you to select how many points you achieved. This is a problem because some people may only remember how many reps they did for the static stations and what their timings were, not the scores themselves. Also, the scoring system is different for both genders and across all age categories. A built it calculator that constantly updates the scores for you is more convenient.

- Theme Change: I found quite a few nicer looking styles. Might change the look of the whole program.

- Goal Setting: Might be an interesting feature, especially if the user wanted to set a goal.

- Calendar + Push Notifications: Perhaps set a new IPPT goal + set a date for an upcoming IPPT + push notifications to remind the user of the IPPT?

I suppose doing a desktop application for this is a bit odd... IPPT Trackers are usually done as smartphone apps. That is for another day.
